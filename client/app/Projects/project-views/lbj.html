          <p>There comes a time in the life of anybody working in tech when they must launch a portfolio site. Like the business cards from American Psycho, or a teamster brotherhood membership card, you just gotta have one to get by in the industry...</p>
          <p>People start asking you: "Hey, what's your site?" or "Let me know your URL". Or at least, you imagine that they might. And that's that.</p>
          <p>I won't reproduce screenshots of the site you are currently viewing. That would just be unfair. Rather, I will try and explain the decisions I've made, and challenges faced.</p>
