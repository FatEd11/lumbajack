        <p>I focus on talking to our users. I listen to the problems they are experiencing. Some are within our existing platform. Others are new problems which we have not yet tried to solve. We then, as a company, work out which problems solving makes financial sense.</p>
        <p>I devise the experiments to solve these problems, the metrics to measure their success, and design the solutions. This is why I love my job: lean product management makes sense to me.</p>

        <h2>Case study: site redesign</h2>
        <p>STL's original front end had a slight Web 1.0 feel to it. We had complaints from users, and so decided to start a redesign process.</p>
        <p>We began interviewing some of our users, to understand their specific problems. From our user interviews we concluded the following problems were most prominent:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Lack of clarity</strong>. Registration buttons, links and document creation buttons were not prominent enough. Leading to high drop out.</li>
          <li><b>Illegibility</b>. Given that the website is content focused, users found the typography difficult to read. And it was worse on mobile devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of obvious support</strong>. Our users felt that we had no clear presence on our own site. Users lacked confidence in the guidance we offered, as we were not available to back it up.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So we began an iterative process with them of:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>creating an initial design, based on our own <strong>hypotheses</strong></li>
          <li>letting our users <strong>critique</strong> this design, and</li>
          <li><strong>refining</strong> the design.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We arrived at a design that made strong use of negative space. We employed a strong, contrasting palette to emphasise actions - including support options. We reworked our typography so it was legible at all display sizes. Additionally we made the layout responsive to changing screen size. </p>
        <h2>The result:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong></strong>Significant upticks in user activation through registration.</li>
          <li> Users spent longer on the site, and engaged with us more often. </li>
          <li>We saw increased clicks on the actions that lead to purchases.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We also packaged our platform up as a whitelabel product. Here are some of the whitelabel sites we built.</p>
