A **MEAN** application hewn with precision to display my code carving mastery. 

Libraries I have used buidling this site (because credit where credit's due):
*    [Daftmonk's angular-fullstack generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) which itself draws upon:
    *    [The MEAN stack...of course](http://mean.io/#!/).
    *    [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) for task management - in which there are too many libraries to list helping out!
    *    [Bower](http://bower.io/) for dependency management.
    *    [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for sexy CSS.
    *    [ui-router](http://angular-ui.github.io/) for awesome routes.
*    [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for CSS goodies, and it's official [Sass port](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass).
*    [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) because who doesn't enjoy an icon font?
*    [Nodemailer](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer) so that peeps can talk to me.
*    [Ladda](http://lab.hakim.se/ladda/) because spinners make life better
